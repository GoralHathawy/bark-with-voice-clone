In the past, Mommy is usually the winner. But the game is somewhat close this time. You've been known to get a little fussy when Mommy wins, so Mommy had to you diaper you in case of any little accidents you may have when you lose. But, this time is different. You have her on the ropes and you're very close to winning. You're feeling so confident this time you even made a wager. If you win, you wont need to wear diapers anymore and have proven you are not a baby. But if you lose, you must wear a diaper for a week straight. And as you're playing, you're doing so well. Seemingly on the edge of winning, doing everything you can. So close now, you have the victory right in your grasp. When all of the sudden, Mommy pulls out that one trick she does time and time again. And you fall for it, you always fall for it. She defeats you once again, and you begin to just sink. You begin to get fussy, and you begin to wet your diaper once again as Mommy defeats you. You begin to whimper as you wet yourself and cry, throwing a little temper tantrum that Mommy beat you once again. That feeling of losing and not being able to do anything about it makes you wet yourself. Mommy gets close, and whispers to you. "Uh oh, I win again" with a smirk. She takes your hand, walks you into the changing room and you feel nothing but shame and humiliation.\"\n",
